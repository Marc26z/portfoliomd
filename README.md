I run 72 services on three servers
- [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/)
- [Start9](https://start9.com/)
- -[PopOS! with a Cloudflare Tunnel](https://pop.system76.com/)
This has given me experience in running my own cloud, ticketing system, full bitcoin node, decentralized blog, a meal management system, and Docker experience in both Linux and Portainer.

## Umbrel Server.

I run an Umbrel Server and host many services on the clear-net using the Cloudflare tunnel.

## Start9 Server
 I also run a start9 Server with services also exposed to the clearnet and TOR

## Bitcoin Node

I began running a full bitcoin node in 2019. I also run two pruned nodes.  You can see the Genesis Block on [my instance of mempool](https://mempool.marcleon.work/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f)

## Peppermint Ticketing System

You can submit a ticket on my [ticketing system here](https://ticket.bitcoinit.work/submit)

I wrote about it in [my blog here](https://marc26z.npub.pro/post/gain-ticketing-experience/). This service runs on a AMD computer with the PopOS! Operating system and cloudflare.

## Mealie

This is my favorite service on Umbrel. It’s a meal management system that allows me to plan my meals and automate my grocery lists. It saves so much time. You can find [my instance of mealie here(https://mealie.marcleon.work/).

## Self Hosted and Decentralized Blog

I host a ghost blog on Start9 [here](https://marc26z.com/).

### Portainer

I am currently working on a website using WordPress using Portainer on Umbrel.

It’s not done, but the idea is to create a website that allows me to help people learn how to take self custody of bitcoin, run nodes, and mine.

It is not finished, but the idea is to offer bitcoin IT services.

![WordPress In Portainer](https://pics.marcleon.work/api/v1/t/c4250e62ccbefeac872ce9be015c9e9928ef1cab/3j8zlc5w/fit_1920)

## Kindle Book

![zap this book](https://pics.marcleon.work/api/v1/t/fbd1716bf1052690da54f0c9f6be95b13f7a9526/3j8zlc5w/fit_1920)

I began writing a blog about using bitcoin as a medium of exchange in March of 2022. I published 21 of these blogposts into [a book you can find here](https://www.amazon.com/Zap-This-Book-Bitcoin-Electronic-ebook/dp/B0DGFG1NSX/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=zap+this+book). I formated it myself. It is very simmilar to Markup languages like HTML and Markdown. 

I haven’t really marketed it and it needs some editing. This is more of a minimally viable product than a polished book.

## Tails On An Air Gapped Computer

I removed the Wi-Fi card and harddrive from an old laptop to create an air gapped computer using [TAILS](https://tails.net/)  [Click here to watch the video hosted on nostr.build](https://v.nostr.build/nb9552.mp4).

## Bitcoin Mining Heater

I converted an old S9 into a space heater. THe 3D printed case was made by CryptoCloaks. The S9 miner was a gift from the first person I met after starting my meetup.

## PeerViewer

This is free and open source software that can be found at https://github.com/PeerViewer/.
- It’s like a free and open source version of RDP on Windows or TeamViewer on Linux.
